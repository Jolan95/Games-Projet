My first project I built gradually it while my I learned the differents programming languages of my web development formation.

I programmed several basic games full Javascript. The flappy Bird project has been fetched on the github repository "kubowania/flappy-bird" that I implemented to my website.

I setted an authentification system binded with a database Mysql which allow users to register their records as well as view the best scores for each game on the site
